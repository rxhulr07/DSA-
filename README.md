# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey 🚀

Welcome!  
This repository contains my code, notes, and solutions as I learn and practice **Data Structures & Algorithms** using Java.

## 📚 Current Focus
- Learning the fundamentals of DSA
- Implementing classic data structures from scratch:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
- Understanding common algorithms:
  - Sorting
  - Searching
- Practicing **LeetCode** questions to strengthen problem-solving skills

## 🛠 Tools & Language
- **Java** (main programming language)
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- Git for version control
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/rxhul07/) for coding practice

## 🏆 Goals
- Master core DSA concepts
- Build confidence in solving problems under time constraints
- Prepare for coding interviews
